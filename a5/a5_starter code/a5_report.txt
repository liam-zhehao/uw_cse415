1. In the context of the Towers-of-Hanoi World MDP, explain how the Value Iteration algorithm uses the Bellman equations to iteratively compute the value table. (5 points)

2. How did you decide your custom epsilon function? What thoughts went into that and what would you change to further optimize your exploration? If your function was strong, explain why. (5 points)

3. What is another exploration strategy other than epsilon-greedy that you believe would fit well with the Towers of Hanoi formulation? Why? (5 points)
